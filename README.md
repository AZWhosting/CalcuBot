console calculator on Telegram via Bot webHooks API, PHP, SSL https://telegram.me/calcubot

1. buy from your ISP a domain name, hosting and SSL certificate
2. post PHP script on a web
3. set through the address bar webhook (it's easier than you may think) have a dedicated team setWebhook. It connects the bot with the script. in the script described how it obtains data from the bot and how returns back
How much is it?
$15 will fit. you can certainly not buy, but then the corresponding node would have to be mounted with his own hands - which for me personally is a big headache
